  "Chapter Content": "\n\n09:48:14, Saturday, 27th May 1329.\n\n\nEve of the Feast of Pentecost.\n\n\nTown of Douglas, Scotland.\n\n\nTeeth ripped and tore as the taut fibres parted. Dust billowed, and a growling roar echoed around the workshop. In the half-light of dawn, the carpenter and apprentice sawed the oaken tree trunk. \nAt only 13 years of age, Liam knew he lacked the strength of a man, and so could only hold the saw blade upright to help guide its path.\n\n\nHis young muscles slowly earned their strength as they guided the weighty metal of the blade. The Master flexed and relaxed much larger muscles as he forced the saw repeatedly through the deep groove they\u2019d cut in the timber.\n\n\n\u201cHold it straight, boy!\u201d Master Colm called over the rumble of the blade as Liam let the tool flex slightly. The saw kicked as friction briefly jammed it in place. The huge man at the other end of the blade grunted as he heaved the handle back and reset his steady rhythm.\n\n\nBack and forth, the serrated metal rocked until the end of the tree trunk fell to the floor with a resounding thump. Colm instructed Liam in tying a chain rig from the roof beam of the workshop to shift the neatened oak log over a trestle for debarking.\n\n\nOnce done, they swung the log into place, securing it with two pegs hammered into the trestle. Liam dodged nimbly around to the master's workbench. Replacing the mallet on its hooks, he picked up the two carpentry axes - one large, the other smaller - that lay on the workbench. As Colm finished removing the chain, Liam handed him the larger of the two carpenters axes. In companionable silence, the two began debarking the log to prepare it for finishing.\nLiam had known Colm since before he could remember, having been raised by his hand. He hadn't known his parents and had always supposed Colm to be an uncle. \nWhen Liam called to the older man by that familial title, Colm had answered him with a smack around the ear and a stern lecture about the difference between family and apprenticeship. According to the Master, family only begot expectations that led to sloth, pride and envy. Liam thought it likely the reason the gruff Master Carpenter had never married.\nEven so, the ageing Master was the closest thing to family Liam knew.\n\n\nThe sun rose past its zenith as the two worked. The heat of their labour soon told, causing both apprentice and master to drip from perspiration despite the cool autumn day near the Scottish border.\n\n\nLiam worked hard, but his heart wasn\u2019t in it. He chipped swiftly with the axe, planeing the bark from the wood while daydreaming of becoming a knight and achieving magnificent and chivalric deeds. He was bored to death of this work. Bored of the repetitive, slow, uncomfortable tedium.\nIf only I was born noble, or found a treasure which would make me wealthy! \nHe thought. \nHis mind meandered to thinking of the how local village girls would all stand about, admiring him as he passed, riding into town, victorious and bedecked with beautiful metal armour with gilded sword at his hip. Of course, the local lads would stare enviously. Covetous of his heavy warhorse and obvious wealth.\n\n\nThe appeal of those daydreams beckoned to him as he lost concentration. The axe shifted in his hand and skidded across the bark as the alignment left true. Liam started and looked up; red faced.\n\n\n\u201cPay attention, you fool boy.\u201d Colm rumbled, as he worked. \nLiam looked over the damage. Had he angled the axe the other way, Liam would have cut too deeply into the log. That would have dug the blade into the pristine wood beneath the bark, damaging any future finish it may hold.\n\n\nLiam did not mind admonishment from the gruff older man. He had grown used to the carpenter's brusque attitude. While his words were always harsh in reprimand, his anger was like a squall. Fierce, but fleeting.\nIt did, however, cause many in the town to avoid the Carpenter when he was in a dark mood.\n\n\nColm was from Connachta, a devout catholic, and a regular drunk. But with a chisel and mallet to hand, he could carve wood as fine as a monk could draw letters in a Bible. This made his work sought by many great lords. Some even claimed he had built chairs for the King's household. An honour that - if true - made Colm an important artisan indeed.\n\n\nTo all who sought his services, the finery of his work was clear. The intricately wrought sign above the entry to the workshop stood as a proud testament to his skill.\n\n\nColm\u2019s best paying customer was Lord Douglas\u2019 Seneschal. He would arrive once each month to negotiate a new order on behalf of one noble or another. Some wealthier lords even ordered new furnishings for their holdings on a semi-regular basis. Often, they asked for war-bows, but Colm always refused.\nThose days were Liam's favorite, as work would stop as the Carpenter negotiated. After completing his chores, he was free to roam as he would. Whenever he could, he would rush head to the Bakery to loiter and play with the baker's apprentice, Duncan, and his dog, Lady. Duncan's mother and father were often generous to their son's orphan friend, especially with the fresh, hot pastries the Baker produced.\nLiam tried to have as little to do with the Keep as he could. Its servants and nobles were ever intimidating figures for the apprentice. Worse, their fine ways made him feel deeply inadequate.\n\n\nWhen in town, he would spy the Keep\u2019s servants as they carried out some important errand at the behest of the Seneschal or Lord. They rarely troubled to stop anywhere near the carpentry sheds. These lay far from the Outer Bailey\u2019s coldly practical stone fa\u00e7ade. Liam had caught none of the servants' names, nor had business with them. \nAnd so, he had kept focused on his apprenticeship, only socializing with Duncan, and rarely with the other common children when they let him. Despite his muck-common roots, he never felt the urge to stop his imagination from concocting tales of how he would one day live within the stout walls of his own Keep. He imagined it would be just like the Lord's home.\n\n\nDouglas Keep itself was a blocky affair. Each tower rose to nearly half again the height of the curtain walls, which were squat but thick. They loomed above the town, breaking up the skyline with their crenellations, standing four times the height of a tall man.\n\n\nThe main buildings of the Keep were barely visible over the curtain walls, yet to Liam they were wonders to be admired. They seemed works of mighty labour, unmatched anywhere in the world - not that Liam had been anywhere else. Still, he thought of the walls as tall and imposing, encircling the greatest keep in Scotland. \nAs the walls were so mighty, Liam thought it stood to reason that they would guard treasures and wealth he could only imagine.\n\n\nThe greatest prize defended by the Castle was not mere gold or precious stones - Liam knew. It was the radiant Star of Douglas.\n\n\nThe Lord's wife.\nLiam had no words to describe her, but in his thirteen-year-old orphan mind, she radiated beauty and an ethereal grace. Every boy in the village held an unspoken crush on her, making her the immediate envy of all the younger village girls.\n\n\nHer escort always ignored the boys\u2019 open-mouthed stares of awe at the veiled lady. It was but harmless admiration, after all. So long as the boys stayed quiet and bowed their heads in deference to their Lord\u2019s wife as she passed, the guards rode on.\n\n\nDespite her status in the fief's hierarchy, the Lord was only hand-fast to the lady, having never had much time for religion since his youth. The Bishopric had not complained, nor had the people, as all knew the lady was virtuous, compassionate and beloved of God.\n\n\nA sharp pain suddenly blossomed behind Liam\u2019s ear. \u201cI will not tell you again, boy. If ye don't pay attention to task, you\u2019ll have no feast tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\nLiam knew that was a hollow threat, more to get him back to the task than to make him fear hunger. His ears burned, not with pain at the rebuke, but with shame at his failing.\n\n\nLooking back to the trunk, it was clear that their work neared completion. Cheered by the thought Liam continued on, though still bored. \nThus it was not long before his mind returned to an adolescent fugue of competing thoughts and daydreams. \nLiam's heat jumped as the axe dug into the trunk. There, a splinter of wood was sprung up, it's tip narrowly missing Liam's hand.\n\"Go mbrise an diabhal do dh\u00e1 chois!\" Colm swore, setting down his axe as he jostled Liam aside. He leaned in close, rubbing at the splinter with calloused fingers to inspect the damage. \nLiam stood shamefaced. He'd only understood a bit of the Irishman's' native tongue, but he caught the drift. \"May the devil break your two legs.\" Colm was ever inventive with curses, especially when speaking the lilting Gaelic of his homeland. \nLiam looked at the damage. \nIt was not good.\nIf they merely removed the splinter, it would only ruin the final finish. \nTo repair it would take most of an afternoon. They would need to prepare and set a resin that would bond the splinter back into place.\n\n\nColm turned his glare upon his apprentice, and Liam sank deeper into his mope.\n\n\nHe knew his daydreaming was unusual. But with the upcoming feast, he had been looking forward to the full week of rest granted by the Pentecost, and the distraction led his thoughts in all sorts of directions.\nThe feast marked the day upon which the holy spirit had descended to Christ and his apostles. Every year, people gathered at the parish church in celebration. There they received mass, along with absolution. Next, they would accept the Pentecostal spirit from the Holy Mother Church. \nThe prospect excited Liam. He\u2019d always felt love for his God and hoped that this year He would answer Liam\u2019s prayers and grant a path to become a man-at-arms, and eventually a Knight!\n\n\nColm could see dashed hope mixing with shame burn hot upon Liam\u2019s face. They both knew he had no excuse for his failing, but Colm reasoned that sometimes restraining the dreams of youth was counter-productive, especially after hours of monotonous work. \nThe older man sighed, turning his glare into a patient smile.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be fixing that soon enough, lad. As I prepare the resin, you\u2019ll be taking a break! I want you to fetch some firewood from the forest. Take the splitting axe but be back before dark.\u201d He said, gesturing to where it lay next to a basket of firewood. \n\u201cMaybe tomorrow the Holy Spirit will set your head to its task rather than letting it traipse through the clouds!\u201d He chortled at his own joke, causing Liam to roll his eyes. Colm caught the gesture and raised the back of his hand in mock threat. \u201cAway with Ye!\u201d\n\n\nLiam grinned and nodded gratefully. \n\u201cYes, Master!\u201d \nWhile Colm could be a hard master, he was never violent beyond reason, and always eased the impact of any reprimand. Liam admired him for that trait. He\u2019d always found those with an unchecked temper to others were also those who lost friends, and just as quickly, made enemies.\nStill, Liam had no desire to \nbecome \nColm. A path he knew with a deep certainty lay in his future, unless he found an alternate trade. \nThis was why Liam put all his energy into work. He had set his sights firmly on becoming a soldier, and one day - God willing - a Knight. To achieve such lofty goals, he would need all the strength he could muster.\nThe best thing about Colm from Liam\u2019s perspective was that he always encouraged the young apprentices to be in motion. \nOne method the old Carpenter employed was to measure the firewood the apprentices collected for size and width. If he were unsatisfied, Colm would send the boys out once more to collect two bundles of the deadfall for every one he found fault with. Liam imagined it was knightly training and set about the chore with abundant effort.\nThe solution Liam had discovered was to only take deadfall from the larger branches, and that meant breaking the wood.\n\n\nOne day, tired of using his body weight to break the branches off the fallen boughs, he had asked Colm to borrow his heavy splitting axe. \nGlad that at least his younger apprentice was taking the work seriously, his master had agreed, but warned him to be careful.\nThe Master Carpenter knew a boy must be free to make the mistakes of a child in order to become a man, but a splitting axe could take off a leg as easily as a branch. Before letting the lad maim himself with the axe, Colm had walked Liam into the woods and shown him how to swing the heavy tool safely. \nLiam still remembered. \nHave your feet wide apart and both hands firmly on the axe. All cuts are to be made away from any part of the body and between the feet. Never across them. \nOf course, Liam had still made the stupid mistake of running a finger along the blade to test its edge. He'd received quite a nasty cut. The scar remaining reminding him not to be careless with tools.\nFortunately, Colm maintained his workshop with bandages and medicaments of many kinds. He ensured all the poultices and potions he wanted were fresh-made and sanctified before he brought them from the nearby monastery healers.\nLiam was rarely injured, but the few times it had happened, the master always spent considerable coin on ensuring he had the best care possible. Because of that, as well as the constant advice and training, Liam felt he owed the older man a great deal.\nApologizing once more to his master for ruining the finish, Liam left the workshop, stepping into the sunshine of a bright summer's day. The Carpenter watching him go.\nNow freed from the shackles of the workshop\u2019s labour, Liam darted to the woodshed by the path to the workshop, grabbing the splitting axe from its home above the dwindling woodpile. \nAs he disappeared out into the afternoon light, Colm stared after his apprentice as the lad ran down the path towards the town - the opposite direction from the forest - he gave a sigh of exasperation mixed with bemused pride. He knew Liam would return with a good weight of firewood. The lad always did.\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll do, Lord.\u201d he said to the ceiling of the empty workshop.\n\n\n**********\n\n\nLiam stopped sprinting as soon as he\u2019d made it to the end of the dirt track that ran to the road from the carpentry workshop. This ensured he could pretend not to hear Colm should he call Liam back. Grinning, he hurried down the rest of the small rise on which the workshop nestled.\n\n\nThe seat of Douglas was a small town by the standards of any city-man, and those from Edinburgh or York would see only a village. To Liam, it was plenty big enough to keep exploring in his earnest and eager way.\n\n\nTo Liam\u2019s eye, the shape of Douglas township appeared as a slice of pie. A brook that powered the saw and grain mill bordered it on one side, and on the other, a steep-sided ridge rose in height as it ran towards the keep. These features intersected behind the keep, giving the eastern wall a natural moat, and the western a natural defensive ditch.\nBetween these geographical features and North of the Keep, the town nestled.\nDouglas\u2019 layout reflected a hierarchy of importance to the Lord, with the most important traders and workshops closest to the gate into the keep. The further buildings were less important - or like the carpentry workshop - required access to other buildings that were too large for a prominent location. \nNot far away from the carpentry was the town sawmill, which industriously rumbled in low resonating tones as Liam passed. Its waterwheel churning the dark waters into white foam.\n\n\nThe most distant building from the gate was the tannery. Sited a respectful distance away, it lay across the small brook that ran into and past the moat surrounding the keep.\n\n\nAs usual, Liam took a wide detour, heading first towards the Keep to find his friend.\n\n\nThe baker\u2019s son, Duncan, usually skived off at midday while the bread was being kneaded. Although this was Duncan\u2019s responsibility, the apprentice ensured he did an awful job of kneading. After finding a variety of stones, hay and rat droppings in the dough, his father used Duncan almost entirely to fetch and carry. Liam knew Duncan well for the layabout he was, but he was also his closest friend.\n\n\nTo tell the truth, Duncan was his only friend, and the two indulged their imaginations of as much as they could. \nThey could not for much longer. The church regarded the age of men as fourteen. This meant that while the town still viewed Liam and Duncan as children, they were only months from becoming men.\nGirls, of course, were women as soon as their moon blood came in. No man expected them to be a wife, or to fulfil those duties. Rather, maids looked to the care of the younger children, amongst other chores. As they grew older, their household responsibilities increased to a point where they could learn the skills they\u2019d need to spin, darn, and dye cloth. They also learnt to keep a house and raise children as their future husband - and the village - would expect of them.\n\n\nLiam looked at the older boys - or \u201cMen\u201d as they demanded the younger lads call them - with not a little jealous scorn. They traipsed around the town like pheasants, all plumage and no meat. The other carpenter's apprentice was currently out of town in Edinburgh. He was delivering two decorative wooden wall carvings to the Bailiff\u2019s residence. It had already been a fortnight, and neither the Master nor Liam expected him to return.\n\n\nHis name was Roger, and despite being the older and apparently more responsible apprentice, was a bully and slacker. He\u2019d made Liam do much of his work on top of Liam\u2019s own with threats of a whipping the next time he went to fetch logs.\n\n\nThe last time, Liam confronted Roger. Liam finally reached a height large enough to confront the bully, and with Duncan they had. The ambush and subsequent beating had resulted in a lengthy explanation to Colm. Colm - it turned out - was indifferent to Roger\u2019s pain, only demanding that Liam apologise to him for the lost work-time Roger would need to recover.\n\n\nLiam\u2019s action had also resulted in a nod of approval from the gruff carpenter and a great deal of respect from the local boys - as well as the attention of some girls.\n\n\nDuncan was nowhere to be seen as Liam looked into the Baker\u2019s yard, and so he set off towards the Forest alone. It would be safe enough, the only danger being migratory wolves in the area. Yet these were a rare sighting that led to a hunt for most of the men in the town.\n\n\nAn event which had not happened since Liam turned six.\n\n\nOf course, the kill for the last wolf belonged to the Lord. His wolfhounds would corner and maul the beast, holding it for the killing blow. The Lord preferred to use an axe for the job of killing animals. He used a sword for men.\n\n\nFrom what Liam had heard of the Lord, he was an eminently practical man and had built himself a solid reputation as both a warlord and as a warrior in his own right. James \u201cThe Black\u201d Douglas, Lord of Douglas and friend of King Robert the Bruce, was not a man to cross.\n\n\nHe was also not a greedy man and held himself to the same lessons passed on by Christ that he had learned as a squire in France from his mentor, the last Archbishop of St Andrews.\n\n\nLiam wished he\u2019d seen even a small part of the wars against the English. They must have been amazing. The clash of glittering blades, the dance of warriors trained to the highest standards of war. The honours of battle borne on shields bedecked with heraldry, the chivalry of knights, and the admiration of women everywhere.\n\n\nLiam was still daydreaming as he made his way to the edge of the wood a mile further down the road. Around him, tall trees cast dappled shadows across the sparse ground cover. Pine needles and leaf matter crunched underfoot as he began searching for deadfall suitable for his needs. While wood in the forest was abundant, it was also illegal to cut any timber from living trees without permission from the King or Lord. And so, Liam and the rest of the village scavenged their firewood or brought fuel from the charcoal burners that plied their trade deeper within the woods. They also used dried dung when available, but few enjoyed sourcing that fuel.\n\n\nLiam kept wandering, looking for fresh deadfall. It was always easier to find fresh deadfall than older timber for cutting.\n\n\nWood that had dried in the deep forest caused axes to bounce and skip across its toughened surface.\n\n\nAs Liam returned to the road that wound through the forest, he found just what he had been looking for! \nThis size of deadfall was a rarity in the woods. An entire tree had fallen here recently, despite the dense tree cover on each side of the road. To find an entire tree fallen across the road surprised Liam. Usually, tall trees would hang up on each other, only falling once a section entirely rotted through.\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Liam said aloud, \u201cOne should never turn down a gift from God.\u201d\n\n\nThe axe cut deeply into the flesh of the wood, and soon Liam had built up a sweat. He kept up a steady rhythm as he heard in the distance a rumble of thunder. Liam cursed under his breath as he picked up the pace, carefully ensuring that despite the frantic swinging his axe kept aligned so the edge bit deeply. He knew he would have to rush if he wanted to return to the village in any condition to see the lady of the castle leave for her evening ride.\n\n\nFinally, the axe bit through the pith of one bough. He had hewn a wedge out of the heavy wood on each side, so with the final blow, he had a solid wheel of timber. With this, he\u2019d be able to section the wood into more manageable wheels he could push to town by himself. From there, he could break each section up further into three thick bundles of firewood. Ones the Master Carpenter would be proud of.\n\n\nWith a fallen branch, Liam levered the end of the thick bough onto its side, ready to be sectioned for the roll back to town. \nLooking up, it surprised Liam to see six of Lord Douglas\u2019s soldiers coming along the track, accompanied by the Lady of Douglas herself. She had left the castle early today. \nLiam, covered in sweat and woodchips from his exertions, bowed his head as he knelt so no one would see his face. As the lead guard approached, he eyed Liam warily.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing, boy? Clear the road!\u201d\nThe Guard leant forward when Liam did not immediately reply, thus saving his own life. \nAn arrow passed harmlessly by; its fletching rang loudly off the helmet\u2019s aventail of chainmail.\n\n\n\u201cAMBUSH!\u201d\nThe guard lost no time drawing his sword and pulling his shield over his shoulder, struggling with the sling that held it on his back. The man just had time to ready his arms in front of him. \nAnother arrow sliced through his chain hauberk and fully through his body, tenting the mail coif just below his neck. \nBlood poured out of the guardsman's mouth as he toppled from the saddle.\n\n\nThree of the guards in the Lady\u2019s retinue reacted quickly, charging their mounts into the tree line to seek out and slay their attackers. Two more men raised their shields over the Lady\u2019s head, disregarding their own protection in order to ensure the safety of their charge.\n\n\nTwo arrows flew beneath them and struck the Lady\u2019s mount. With a whinny of fear and pain, it reared up and threw her into the muddy road. Landing roughly in the mud, the Star of Douglas collapsed, unmoving.\n\n\nLiam, was paralyzed by terror. Before him, the fallen man-at-arms gasped and choked on his own blood, Liam crouching directly over him tried to offer comfort, but all that he could manage was a whimper of fear\nTheir eyes locked for a moment, and then the man's face went slack. Liam didn't realize what had happened. He'd never seen death before, let alone a violent one.\nLiam heard a second roll of thunder and a crash close by, although he barely noticed it. The sound of his own heartbeat muting all other noise.\n\n\nA hard blow on his shoulder knocked Liam into the mud of the road. \nHe fell, grime coating his face and jacket as dark-clad figures moved past him. \nThey ignored Liam, as he crouched, frozen in terror in the mud of the road. Blood splashed over him as a man knelt down and drew a dagger across the throat of the already dead man-at-arms.\n\n\nNow fed by gravity rather than his heart, the guards blood trickled out slowly. Unable to comprehend what was happening, Liam stared as the rain continued to pour down, diluting the crimson vitae with the mud of the road.\n\n\nLooking up, he saw the men had continued their advance on the Lady of Douglas and her remaining guard. \nUnable to act, Liam put his faith in God. He closed his eyes and prayed.\n\n\nHe prayed harder than he\u2019d ever prayed before.\n\n\nReopening his eyes, he felt a burning shame when he saw nothing had changed.\n\n\nThe enemy were almost upon the Lady\u2019s guard, and in desperation, Liam cried out in protest.\n\n\nWhat he cried went unheard as a horn sounded.\n\n\nIt was not the sound of a hunting horn; nor a mere bugle, but a powerful blast of noise that shook the pillars of the earth.\n\n\nThe blast of the horn continued for almost a full minute before strange symbols formed in front of Liam\u2019s eyes. As he tried to recover, he vomited his meagre breakfast onto the mud and blood of the road. The roaring horn's blast was the worst pain he\u2019d ever experienced. He could see others similarly emptying their stomachs or writhing in the muddy roadway.\n\n\nHe reached up to his lips, smelling a sharp iron scent. His fingers came away bloody, and his ears were ringing. The symbols before his eyes disappeared when he willed them away, but yet more appeared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunissima lingua scripta regionis:\n\n\nLatinus\nLingua assignata\n\n\nRatio Tribulationis incepta est:\n\n\nExperientia sunt Determinato.\nAttributa sunt assignata.\nSic Titular sunt Determinato.\n\n\nDeus te protegat in iudiciis tuis. Pars duo Apocalypsis Incipit.\n\n\nSit fortuna tua semper sit bonum!\n(Translation in Spoiler)\n\n\n\n\nTranslation to English: \nLanguage assigned.\nThe system of the Tribulation begins. \nExperience has been determined. \nAttributes are assigned.\nThus the Titles have been determined.\nMay God protect you in your judgments. \nPart two of Revelation begins. \nMay your luck always be good!\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t read but recognized some symbols as letters, similar to those from the Carpenters\u2019 sign. Whatever they meant could wait.\n\n\nFinally, shaking his head clear, he saw the ambushers once more advancing on the Lady. Now, however, five guards awaited their attack.\n\n\nThe three guards who had ridden into the woods now returned to the road, fresh blood dripping off their swords, showing they had dealt with at least some archers. A soft glow of golden light seemed to emanate from their forms. Somehow, they had remained in their saddles and the beasts seemed unaffected by the horns. \nThe mounted warriors of Douglas formed up across the road to confront the new threat.\n\n\nThe two sides charged each-other. Steel flashed as the assailants fell to well-timed cuts, lunges and counter blows from the expertly trained mounted warriors. The ambushers' bodies fell into the road, either slain outright or screaming as they bled out in the mud.\n\n\nThe ambushers, however, were far from defeated. More arrows flew from a remaining archer. He had stepped out into the road and began rapidly releasing his black-fletched darts into the mounted force of Douglas armsmen. \nThe black shafts slammed into the guards. Despite the archer's deadly volley, the Douglas Men at Arms fought on, slaying most of the remaining bandits before they reached Lady Douglas. With a final swing which almost decapitated one of the remaining five bandits, the last of the trio fell from his saddle, three arrows having pierced his body. \nNow, only the two mounted men closely guarding the Lady remained.\n\n\nLiam watched in frozen horror as a dark glow flowed around the archer. The bandit smiled wickedly as he drew his bow once more. Liam swore he could hear the screams of the damned emanating from the man, causing him to freeze solid in terror.\n\n\nWhy can\u2019t I move? \nLiam asked himself.\n\n\nMOVE! DO SOMETHING!\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t control himself!\n\n\nFear owned his mind, constricting his movements to mere twitches.\n\n\nRUN!\n\n\nThis he could do. Lifting himself out of the muddy roadway, his legs slowly moved. As he reached the edge of the tree line, guilt filled him as he heard the Lady\u2019s guard cry out in fear and anguish.\n\n\nIf I leave here without trying to save them, what kind of man will I be?\n He asked himself. \nWhat kind of Christian will I be?\n\n\nHe looked on as the four remaining assailants approached the fallen Lady and her guards warily.\n\n\nLiam saw that the raiders had felled a tree behind the mounted party. It lay across the path back to Douglas, thick pine branches blocking any escape on horseback in that direction.\n\n\nIt was then he realized how foolish he'd been. The felled tree he'd been dismantling was no gift from God, but a barrier created by the Lady's enemies!\n\n\nLiam looked on, his mind working quickly through the fear now. \nThey're trapped\n! He realized. \nBut what use can I be against trained enemies?\n\n\nThe Men at Arms protecting the Lady ignored the false hope of retreat. Instead, the two remaining guards drew swords, interposing their mounts and bodies between the unhorsed Lady and her assailants.\nLiam gathered his thoughts, remembering a sermon from long ago. \nHe whispered familiar words the town Priest had read from the Bible long ago. \u201cRescue the weak and the needy, deliver them from the hand of the wicked.\u201d\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t sure why he remembered that verse, but knew it was the good and Christian thing to do.\nIt\u2019s your Christian duty to help others in need! \nLiam thought, affirming the sermon.\n\n\nReturning to the road, Liam tried to pick up the sword of the first fallen man-at-arms. Liam desperately pulled at the blade, but it lay trapped beneath the man\u2019s body. He glanced around in a panic. He had no plan, no weapon, and no chance!\nSuddenly, he realized a weapon had been within reach all along!\n\n\nYOUR AXE, YOU FOOL!\nHe reached down next to him to find the familiar handle of the splitting axe.\n\n\nThe remaining guards had spurred their mounts towards the ambushers, who leapt aside as they swung their long polearms towards the mounted men. The guards defended each blow from the ambushers, replying with deadly accuracy and power, stabbing deep into the flesh of the enemy.\n\n\nBlades now flashed red as trained steel slashed deep gashes through the heads and bodies of the foemen.\n\n\nAfter their initial charge, Liam saw that only two enemies remained. \nHe cried out a warning to the guards as he saw what was about to happen.\nOne was the archer, who held his bow drawn, an arrow nocked. \nSeeing the danger, Liam thought to throw his axe at the man, but the archer was faster.\n\n\nHe released the arrow directly into the back of one guard as he slowed his mount to turn. Drawing a second arrow, his victim toppled from the saddle with a screech of pain. The piercing dart had embedded itself through the soldier's back and out of his lower right side.\n\n\nThe man's scream ceased abruptly after he fell from his horse, landing on the shaft of the dart, as his own weight forced the arrow back into the wound. \nThe dying man did not suffer long, however, as his mount, startled by the shriek, stamped its foot down once on the man\u2019s neck.\n\n\nThe last guard saw his comrade\u2019s demise and dismounted, knowing that his only chance to save himself and the Lady was to fight on foot. The horse gave him some mobility, but in the confined space of the road, the size of the beast was a disadvantage, not a boon. \nAs he kicked free of his mount, the archer's second arrow release. It gouged a long red slash across the horse\u2019s flank, causing it to buck and kick out. \nKnocked out of the saddle by the sudden movement of his mount, the falling man at arms crashed into Liam. The impact knocking the wind out of the pair as they collapsed into the mud of the road.\n\n\nRecovering faster than Liam would have thought possible, the guard snatched the axe out of the apprentice's unyielding hands. Clambering to his knees, the man twisted, sweeping the heavy axe viciously at the rapidly approaching foemen.\n\n\nHe had somehow kept his shield, placing it before him while swearing viciously as he got to his feet, his weight unbalanced by a deep limp. \nAnother arrow from the archer flashed out, this time caught by the shield. The impact was so great it pushed the guard back a step. Liam could see the arrowhead had gone right through the shield to stick out a good six inches from the wood. Luckily for the man-at-arms, it had missed his flesh.\n\n\nLiam also lurched to his feet, searching for anything he could use. The impact had knocked the wind from his lungs, and he heaved deep breaths of air as he scampered towards the injured horse. Lying in the mud, he found what he was looking for, the guardsman\u2019s fallen sword.\n\n\nWhile it was muddy, the grip on the blade felt good in his hand, and he wiped most of the mud off the handle. As he did so, he glimpsed its craftsmanship. This was no guard\u2019s blade!\n\n\nIt was beautiful, light and balanced, and Liam found it easy to wield.\n\n\nHe turned back towards the fight to see the remaining two raiders were now circling the remaining guard, separating so that they could both attack without risk of hitting each-other.\n\n\nThe soldier clearly knew this, and rapidly attacked the archer, risking a blow from the man with the polearm to his side. He winced as he lunged, heavily favoring his right foot. Whatever damage he\u2019d done to his leg was enough to impede him, and he stumbled, barely deflecting the polearm with his shield.\n\n\nAs the archer danced back from the swing of the woodsman's axe, his partner swung the polearm once more towards the knights now undefended body.\nThe weapon descended.\nThen the world shook.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n"
